# RMap Installation

The documents in this section support installation of RMap. 

* [Software Stack](software-stack.md) - provides a representation of the RMap software as a block diagram. Describes each component involved.
* Installation descriptions:
  * [Installation 1.0.0-beta](installation-1-0-0-beta.md) - detailed step by step instructions for installing each component of RMap v.1.0.0-beta.
  * [Installation Scripts 1.0.1-beta](installation-scripts-1-0-1-beta.md) - Instructions for using the installation scripts. This includes a script for backing up and restoring the GraphDB database.
  * [Installation 2.0.0-beta (brief)](installation-2-0-0-beta-brief.md) - Installation documentation is incomplete and the scripts have not been updated to reflect the latest version of RMap. This outlines what a full installation of RMap 2.0.0-beta would look like if a knowledgeable system adminstrator were to attempt it. 
  
In addition to these instructions, there are also several projects in GitHub that can support starting up a local instance of RMap. These require Docker.
* [RMap Developer Runtime for integration tests](https://github.com/rmap-project/rmap/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md#developer-runtime)
* [RMap Docker project](https://github.com/rmap-project/rmap-docker)
